The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\n\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

WAAS Express provides the following benefits:\\n❖ Bandwidth optimization\\n❖ Application acceleration\\n❖ Increase in remote user productivity\\n❖ Interoperation with existing Cisco WAAS infrastructure\\n❖ Network transparency\\n❖ Deployment flexibility with on-demand service enablement\\n• The Wexp is about the wide Area Application Service on IOS (Router) itself.\\n• Mainly involves to checks the functionality of optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS,\\nSMB and Config_sync.\\n\\nPRODUCT WAAS Express(Wide Area Application Services)\\n\\nPROJECT CISCO-WAAS\\nCLIENT Cisco Systems\\nORGANISATION HCL Technologies Ltd\\n\\nSoftware Engineer - Automation & Testing\\n\\n-\\n\\nJune 2011 to December 2012\\n\\n• Identified the automatable cases from the test plan.\\n• Prepared the HLD document for the automatable cases.\\n• Automated test cases for various components on the waas product for the functionality check.\\n• Worked on Plaform, SNMP, SSL, HTTP component automation.\\n• Automated around 600+ cases for various components.\\n• Performed regression for all the automated cases through ATS framework with aetest script\\ntemplate.\\n• Active Participation in automating test cases for sanity test.\\n• Reviewed the automated cases developed by team members.\\n• Involved in executing all the automated cases and reporting bugs/defects.\\n• Worked on various releases of the products (Lancer, Phoenix, Skyhawk) for regressing the\\nautomated cases and posted results in TIMS tool.\\n• Defect filing in CDETS\\n\\nLANGUAGE TCL Programming, Python\\nRELEASES LANCER, PHOENIX, SKYHAWK, SPRIT\\nDESCRIPTION\\n• Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) is a Cisco Systems technology that improves the\\nperformance of applications on a wide area network (WAN). WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\\napplications on a given network.\\n• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\\n\\n\\n\\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\\n• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\\n• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\\ncheck.\\n\\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\\n\\nEDUCATION\\n\\nB.E in CSE\\n\\nANNA University\\n\\n2011\\n\\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\\n\\n2005 to 2007\\n\\nSKILLS\\n\\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\\n\\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\\n\\nTechnical Skills\\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\\nWCCP Protocol,\\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\\nSoftware\\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\\n\\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux\",\n","  'entities': [(7880, 8485, 'PRODUCT'),\n","   (7829, 7835, 'DATE'),\n","   (7810, 7816, 'DATE'),\n","   (7795, 7801, 'DATE'),\n","   (7777, 7783, 'DATE'),\n","   (7745, 7836, 'DATE'),\n","   (7731, 7734, 'DATE'),\n","   (7687, 7721, 'PERSON'),\n","   (7681, 7684, 'DATE'),\n","   (7664, 7679, 'DATE'),\n","   (7652, 7661, 'ORG'),\n","   (6598, 6610, 'ORG'),\n","   (5659, 5662, 'DATE'),\n","   (5629, 5649, 'ORG'),\n","   (5560, 5572, 'ORG'),\n","   (3651, 3671, 'ORG'),\n","   (3503, 3515, 'ORG'),\n","   (3481, 3501, 'ORG'),\n","   (1304, 1324, 'ORG'),\n","   (1288, 1300, 'ORG'),\n","   (1174, 1186, 'ORG'),\n","   (1152, 1172, 'ORG'),\n","   (1136, 1148, 'ORG'),\n","   (170, 176, 'DATE'),\n","   (102, 165, 'DATE'),\n","   (64, 70, 'GPE'),\n","   (42, 62, 'ORG'),\n","   (26, 38, 'ORG'),\n","   (0, 24, 'PERSON')]},\n"," {'text': \"Yathishwaran P\\nMaximo Consultant - Infosys Limited\\n\\nNamakkal, Tamil Nadu - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Yathishwaran-P/a9c8d42210af40b8\\n\\n• Maximo Consultant in Infosys Limited, Chennai from August 2013 till date (around 4.8 years)\\n• IT professional with 4.4 years of experience in BIRT reporting, application support in IBM MAXIMO\\nApplication.\\n• IBM Certified MAXIMO ASSET MANAGEMENT, PURCHASE ORDER, PROCUREMENT, PURCHASE\\nREQUISITION Professional\\n• Submitted Internal tutorial document on Configuration of Hover Dialogs and Its usage in Maximo\\nV7.6\\n• Worked on various customer requirements and having overall experience with\\n➢ Preventive Maintenance\\n➢ Maximo automation and implementation\\n➢ MBO customizations\\n➢ Data Supply chain\\n➢ Portals, Workflows Designing\\n➢ Reports/Query Creation\\n➢ Work order tracking, Invoicing, Purchase order\\n➢ Asset Management\\n➢ Maximo Integration Framework (MIF)\\n➢ Labors, Crews, Security Group Set up\\n➢ Domains, Database configuration\\n➢ Basics of BIRT, Cognos Reporting, Monitor logs from Admin console.\\n➢ Maximo Java customization\\n➢ Maximo Installation/Upgradation\\n➢ Basic WebSphere function\\n\\n• Strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work in team efficiently.
